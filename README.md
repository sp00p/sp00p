# Hello fellow developer(s)!

My name is Sean. I'm 19 years old and I'm from the United States. I'm currently pursuing a degree in biochemistry as Arizona State University. I mainly use this place for side projects or terrible ideas that go horribly wrong. 

I enjoy programming in C++, Java, Lua, and Javascript. Maybe one day I'll make something cool.
